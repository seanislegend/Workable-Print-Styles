# Workable-Print-Styles

Workable surprisingly has no styles when printing a job brief. This makes it nicer to print and use! 

I use the [Styler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/styler/bogdgcfoocbajfkjjolkmcdcnnellpkb?hl=en) plugin from Chrome. I'm sure there are others for Chrome and other browsers...
